# Death-Game-of-Random-Number-Demo
This is made by OmakoZplus, try it out be careful, you may get some screen showing you something it is still as a demo. It is open source so I do not care what you do with it. Make a creepypasta or something alike game. Used Python for it.

Here are some screenshots of the game:

It is yet still as a demo, but try it out, make changes or create your own version of it, by the way if you want to know the music of the game here with some of the background music I used:

Background.mp3 - Dead Silence Theme Song or Soundtrack
so good.mp3 - Parasyte the Maxim OST - Next to You 
sad.mp3 - "MELANCHOLIA" Music Box |Sad, creepy song|
snake.mp3 - Jeff The Killer Theme Song (Piano Version) Sweet Dreams Are Made Of Screams
warning.mp3 - Nathan Larson Avival Pastoral Extend

This is all enjooy!! WAHHAHAHAHAHHAAH!
